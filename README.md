# Autogratuity

## Import Data Flow Fix

This repository contains a fix for the data flow issue between imported data and UI display in the Autogratuity app.

### Issue Description

When importing GeoJSON or other data formats into the app, the import process completes successfully and shows a confirmation of imported records, but the data does not appear in the UI. Investigation showed that the data is partially stored in Firestore, but there's a disconnect between the import processing and the UI data retrieval.

### Solution Implemented

The solution addresses multiple potential points of failure in the data flow:

1. **Missing Data Transformation**: The fix ensures that imported GeoJSON features are properly transformed into delivery records with all required fields.

2. **Incomplete Database Structure**: Ensures that imported records are stored in both the `deliveries` and `addresses` collections with proper structure and links.

3. **UI Refresh Mechanism**: Implements a robust refresh mechanism to ensure the UI properly loads and displays imported data.

4. **User-Friendly Resolution**: A component that detects import issues and helps users resolve them with a single click.

### Component Structure

- `ImportDataService.js` - Core service that handles data processing and resolution
- `ImportResolver.js` - UI component to help users fix their imports
- `Home.js` - Updated home screen with import resolver integration
- `DeliveryStats.js` - Component to display delivery statistics

### How to Use

When a user imports data but doesn't see it in the app:

1. The app automatically detects that an import happened but data isn't showing
2. An "Import Data Issue Detected" card appears at the top of the home screen
3. The user taps "Fix Import Data" to resolve the issue
4. The app processes the import data and properly connects it to the UI
5. Statistics are updated and the resolver disappears when successful

### Technical Notes

- The fix uses batched writes to maintain data consistency
- It handles multiple import sources and data formats
- The service provides detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Proper error handling is implemented at all stages

### Requirements

- React Native
- Firebase/Firestore
- React Navigation
