# Implementation Status Update

## Completed Work (March 15, 2025)

We've made significant progress on the architectural overhaul, particularly in implementing the repository pattern and related components:

### Core Data Models ‚úÖ
- **UserProfile**: Complete model with nested objects for subscription, preferences, etc.
- **SubscriptionStatus**: Model for subscription status with verification support
- **Address**: Comprehensive address model with normalization and statistics
- **Delivery**: Detailed delivery model with timestamps and status tracking
- **SyncOperation**: Model for tracking offline operations and conflict resolution
- **SyncStatus**: Model for tracking overall sync status
- **AppConfig**: Model for application configuration from Firestore
- **DeliveryStats**: Model for delivery statistics calculations

### Data Repository ‚úÖ
- **DataRepository Interface**: Comprehensive interface for all data operations
- **FirestoreRepository**: Complete implementation with all required functionality:
  - User Profile operations
  - Subscription operations
  - Address operations
  - Delivery operations
  - Sync operations
  - Config operations
  - Proper caching with invalidation

### Utilities ‚úÖ
- **NetworkMonitor**: Real-time network connectivity monitoring
- **PreferenceManager**: Type-safe SharedPreferences wrapper
- **JsonSerializer**: GSON-based JSON serialization for model classes

### Application Integration ‚úÖ
- **RepositoryProvider**: Service locator for dependency injection
- **Application Initialization**: Firebase and repository setup

## Next Steps

### 1. Code Organization and Clean-up
- **Maintain Repository Structure**: Continue with modular file structure for better separation of concerns
- **Remove Obsolete Files**: Delete old repository implementation files once migration is complete
- **Code Review**: Ensure consistent coding style and documentation

### 2. UI Integration
- **Address Manager**: Update to use repository pattern
  - Replace direct Firestore calls with repository methods
  - Implement loading states and error handling
  - Add reactive updates using Observable pattern
  
- **Delivery Manager**: Update to use repository pattern
  - Replace direct Firestore calls with repository methods
  - Implement loading states and error handling
  - Add reactive updates using Observable pattern
  
- **Subscription Manager**: Update to use repository pattern
  - Replace direct Firestore calls with repository methods
  - Remove direct SharedPreferences access
  - Use reactive subscription status updates

### 3. Offline Functionality Testing
- **Connection Handling**: Test behavior when connection is lost/restored
- **Sync Operations**: Test queueing and processing of operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test handling of conflicts between local and remote changes

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Pagination**: Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- **Prefetching**: Optimize what data is prefetched on app start
- **Cache Management**: Fine-tune cache TTL and invalidation strategies

### 5. Documentation and Testing
- **Code Documentation**: Ensure all public APIs are properly documented
- **Unit Tests**: Complete unit tests for repository implementation
- **Integration Tests**: Add tests for end-to-end functionality
- **User Guide**: Update user documentation if needed
