# Autogratuity Implementation Plan

## Current Status (March 15, 2025)

We have successfully implemented Phase 1 of the architectural overhaul, focusing on the core data layer components. Here's a detailed breakdown of what's been implemented and what's next.

## Implemented Components

### Core Data Models
- ✅ **UserProfile**: Complete model with nested objects for subscription, preferences, etc.
- ✅ **SubscriptionStatus**: Model for subscription status with verification support
- ✅ **Address**: Comprehensive address model with normalization and statistics
- ✅ **Delivery**: Detailed delivery model with timestamps and status tracking
- ✅ **SyncOperation**: Model for tracking offline operations and conflict resolution
- ✅ **SyncStatus**: Model for tracking overall sync status
- ✅ **AppConfig**: Model for application configuration from Firestore
- ✅ **DeliveryStats**: Model for delivery statistics calculations

### Data Repository
- ✅ **DataRepository Interface**: Comprehensive interface for all data operations
- ✅ **FirestoreRepository**: Implementation with the following features:
  - ✅ User Profile operations (get, update, observe)
  - ✅ Subscription operations (get, update, verify, observe)
  - ✅ Address operations (get, add, update, delete, observe)
  - ⚠️ Delivery operations (stubbed methods only)
  - ⚠️ Sync operations (stubbed methods only)
  - ⚠️ App Config operations (stubbed methods only)
- ✅ **NetworkMonitor**: Utility for monitoring network connectivity
- ✅ **RepositoryProvider**: Service locator for dependency injection

### Application Integration
- ✅ **Application Class**: Initialization of Firebase and repository
- ⚠️ **UI Integration**: Not started yet

## Implementation Priorities

### Week 3: Repository Completion
1. **Complete FirestoreRepository Implementation**
   - Implement delivery methods
   - Implement sync operation methods
   - Implement app config methods
   - Add JSON serialization for SharedPreferences

2. **Complete Unit Tests**
   - Add tests for all repository methods
   - Test network state handling
   - Test conflict resolution

### Weeks 4-5: UI Integration (Subscription Focus)
1. **Subscription UI**
   - Replace SubscriptionManager with repository
   - Update UI to use repository for subscription status
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Implement real-time updates with observables

2. **User Profile UI**
   - Update profile screens to use repository
   - Add input validation
   - Implement offline capabilities

### Weeks 6-7: UI Integration (Address & Delivery Focus)
1. **Address Management**
   - Update address list to use repository
   - Add address editor with validation
   - Implement duplicate prevention UI
   - Add search and filtering

2. **Delivery Management**
   - Update delivery list to use repository
   - Add delivery editor with validation
   - Implement real-time updates
   - Add statistics calculations

### Weeks 8-9: Sync & Offline Support
1. **Background Sync**
   - Implement WorkManager job for background sync
   - Add notification handling
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

2. **Conflict Resolution UI**
   - Add UI for resolving conflicts
   - Implement merge strategies
   - Add user preferences for conflict resolution

### Week 10: Testing & Deployment Prep
1. **Final Testing**
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Offline/online transition testing

2. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Implement security rules
   - Create required indexes
   - Write migration script for existing data
   - Prepare monitoring dashboard

## Feature Implementation Details

### Subscription System
- **Verification Flow**:
  ```
  UI Request → Repository.verifySubscription() → 
  Check Payment Provider → Update Subscription Record → 
  Update User Profile → Update Local Cache → 
  Notify UI via Observable
  ```

- **Offline Handling**:
  ```
  Check Local Cache → Honor Valid Cached Status →
  Queue Verification for When Online → 
  Update Status When Connection Restored
  ```

### Address Management
- **Duplicate Prevention**:
  ```
  Normalize Address → Check for Existing → 
  Return Existing if Found → Create New if Not →
  Update Statistics → Notify UI via Observable
  ```

- **Address Statistics**:
  ```
  Add Delivery → Update Address Stats Atomically →
  Update User Stats → Cache Results →
  Push Updates via Observable
  ```

### Sync System
- **Operation Queueing**:
  ```
  Create Local Operation → Add to Queue →
  Process Immediately if Online →
  Store for Later if Offline →
  Process When Connection Restored
  ```

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  ```
  Detect Version Mismatch → Apply Strategy (Server/Client/Merge) →
  Update Local Version → Notify User if Needed →
  Complete Operation
  ```

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements
1. **Pagination**: Implement proper pagination for large datasets
2. **Advanced Search**: Add full-text search for addresses and deliveries
3. **Cache Optimization**: Implement LRU cache with size limits
4. **Analytics**: Add event tracking for sync failures and performance
5. **Multi-Device Sync**: Improve support for users with multiple devices

## Monitoring Plan
We will track the following metrics during implementation:
- Repository method coverage
- Unit test coverage
- UI component migration progress
- Offline operation success rate
- Sync times (average, p95, p99)
- Error rates by operation type
- Memory usage
- Network usage

## Conclusion
The implementation plan is on track with the core data layer components in place. The focus now shifts to completing the repository implementation and beginning the UI integration, with priority on the subscription components to address the most critical user-facing issues.
