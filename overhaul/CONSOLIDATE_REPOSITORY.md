# Repository Structure Maintenance

The current implementation has several separate files for different aspects of the FirestoreRepository. This structure will be maintained for better separation of concerns and focused development.

## Current Structure
- `FirestoreRepository.java` - Contains core methods and high-level functionality
- `FirestoreRepository_Constructor.java` - Contains the constructor and initialization code
- `FirestoreRepository_ConfigMethods.java` - Contains app config and device methods
- `FirestoreRepository_DeliveryMethods.java` - Contains delivery-related methods
- `FirestoreRepository_PreferenceMethods.java` - Contains helper methods for SharedPreferences
- `FirestoreRepository_SyncMethods.java` - Contains sync operation methods

## Structure Benefits

1. **Focused Development**
   - Each file can be worked on independently
   - Easier to navigate and understand specific functionality
   - Simplified tracking of changes through version control

2. **Improved Testing**
   - Isolated testing of specific functionality
   - Clear separation between different domains
   - Easier to maintain test coverage

3. **Implementation Documentation**
   - Each file clearly documents its purpose
   - Method organization follows domain boundaries
   - Clearer responsibility boundaries

## Implementation Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| FirestoreRepository_Constructor.java | Complete | Already fully implemented |
| FirestoreRepository.java (User Profile & Subscription) | Complete | Already fully implemented |
