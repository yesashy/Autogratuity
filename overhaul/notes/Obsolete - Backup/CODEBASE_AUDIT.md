# Autogratuity Codebase Audit

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the Autogratuity codebase, identifying fully integrated components, partially integrated components, and obsolete files that should be removed. This audit is based on the architectural overhaul that implemented a domain-based repository pattern and the decision to use native Android UI with Material Design.
