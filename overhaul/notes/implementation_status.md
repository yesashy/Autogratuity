# Autogratuity Architectural Overhaul Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Immediate Build Issues**
   - Added missing Firebase dependencies to build.gradle
   - Added Room dependencies for local database
   - Added Gson for JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Added WorkManager dependencies for background processing
   - Applied the Google Services plugin in build.gradle
   - Removed React Native references from AutogratuityApp.java

2. **Addressed Potential Architectural Problems**
   - Implemented RepositoryViewModelFactory for proper ViewModel creation and repository injection
   - Created SyncWorker class for WorkManager integration
   - Repository initialization in RepositoryProvider was already properly implemented

3. **Started Cleanup of Obsolete Files**
   - Added @Deprecated annotations to legacy models:
     - Address
     - Delivery
     - DeliveryData
   - Created flutter_cleanup_instructions.md with steps to safely remove Flutter references
   - The reactnative package was not found in the codebase (likely already removed)

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Complete Flutter Directory Cleanup**
   - Follow instructions in flutter_cleanup_instructions.md to safely remove IDE references

2. **Add Additional Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect changes

3. **Further UI Refinements**
   - Continue implementing Material Design components
   - Enhance ViewModels for UI components

## Summary

The immediate build issues have been resolved by adding the missing dependencies and removing problematic React Native references. The SyncWorker class has been created to support background synchronization. Legacy model classes have been marked with @Deprecated annotations to guide developers to use the new domain-based models instead.

The application should now build successfully, and developers should be directed toward using the new domain-based repository architecture rather than the legacy implementation.
